Seq application for Microsoft Teams

**Important note:** This Seq App packages require Seq 5.0 or later.

# Installation
For the Microsoft Teams Webhook to work you will need to put in the URL to your configured Incoming Webhook created in Microsoft Teams for your channel.

# Note
The models came from here: https://github.com/OfficeDev/BotBuilder-MicrosoftTeams and were modified slightly to include some missing properties (no known package exists with the full model layouts, come on Microsoft!).

Additional note: As of 9/19/2019, for some reason you still cannot send AdaptiveCards, you need to use the older MessageCards with Teams Connectors.
